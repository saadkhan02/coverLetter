\opening{\textbf{Vacancy: Sofware Engineer in Test}}
 
I came across a requirement for a QA Engineer at Regent Education through
LinkedIn. I'm a Test Automation Engineer at Sixnet. Here my duties are to write
test scripts for testing embedded Linux hardware. I design and maintain the
nightly tests and testing framework that validate the software and hardware
features of Remote Terminal Units and the testing framework.

I also help maintain the test servers which run on Ubuntu 14.04. Most of the
testing is done on Linux using Perl and bash. Tests for Windows applications
are also integrated into the same framework using AutoIt and generating the
output in TAP (Test Anything Protocol) format.

I believe I'll be a good fit for the available spot because of my attitude
towards the importance of testing. I also believe that I'll be able to patch
lack of knowledge with hard work. I have experience of building and integrating
test frameworks. I'm a motivated team member and a go getter. I hope to be an
asset to the team if given the opportunity.
