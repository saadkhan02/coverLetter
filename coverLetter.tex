\opening{\textbf{Vacancy: Automation Engineer}}
 
I came across a requirement for an Automation Engineer at The Midtown Group
posted on LinkedIn. I'm a Test Automation Engineer at Sixnet. Here my duties
are to write test scripts for testing embedded Linux hardware. I use a
combination of Perl and bash to design and maintain the nightly tests that
validate the software and hardware features of Remote Terminal Units.

I also help maintain the test servers which run on Ubuntu 14.04. High
availability is a major requirement to keep our customers happy. I've also been
involved in physically commissioning the servers to ensure the quality of our
products.

As a technology enthusiast I've touched upon a lot of cloud offerings such as
those from Amazon Web Services, Dgital Ocean, Linode and Codero to name a few.
I have also setup an experiment cloud running on a small cluster of 3 servers
with a cumulative of 48 GB of RAM and 10 CPU cores managed using OpenStack.

I believe I'll be a good fit for the available spot because of my eagerness
to understand technology, emphasis for high availability and ability to work
both, as a part of a team and on an individual basis.
